# Doctor Desktop Application (Basic Model)

**This app is created from Doctor web application. **

This is a minimal Doctor application based on the [Quick Start Guide] Doctor Web Application using Ionic + AngluarJS Version 2.

A basic Desktop application needs just these files:

- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
- `main.js` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's **main process**.
- `index.html` - A web page to render. This is the app's **renderer process**.
